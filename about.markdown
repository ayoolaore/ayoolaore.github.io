Hi I'm Ayoola, I talk a lot about technology and science in general. Topics I've spent time learning about lately include theoritical computing, artificial intelligence,  web development, open-banking, quantum computing and a bit of pyhsics.
Pyhsics because I believe its the topic that truly ties it all together. 

With flair and passion for technology, I've been lucky enough to work across multiple technology stacks in areas that concern web development programming, on-prem networking, security, datalakes. 

I enjoy setting up new environments, whatever that may be; A greenfeild enterpise cloud project, a brand new web application, a new Security Information and Event Management(SIEM)? That is, walking through architecture, gathering the neccesary artifcats, resources and talents necessary to embark on building a resilient system. 

I use my understanding of fundamental topics like networking protocols, computer architecture and efficient algorithms to design, forsee and troubleshoot resilient and complex systems. 

Experienced tech stack:

    - cloud (aws, azure)
    - networking (on-prem & cloud)
    - web development (node)
    - data storage
    - devOps
        - workflows (github actions)
        - infrastructure-as-code (pulumi, terraform)
        - observabilty (datadog, sumologic)
